# The Odin Project - Weather App Project

- this was the first project to use JS promises, and as such I tried to familiarize myself with those as well as async/await.
- It was fun to hook in the API and after using Java syntax to pull stuff from API, I found myself liking promises quite a bit.
- As always with these TOP projects, I took the time to write all of the code myself and didn't check student examples.
    - I learn a lot more that way! If I'm stuck, it's a much better feeling to finish a task by my own research.
- There is a lot more styling that could be done in the future, I left it somewhat basic for now until I have better ideas.
